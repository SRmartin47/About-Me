<h2 class="city">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
<p>An autonomous car, also known as a robotic car, self-driving car or driverless car. Is a vehicle that can sense its environment and moving with little or no human input. Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s; trials began in the 1950s.</p> 

<p>In 2017, Audi stated that its latest A8 would be automated at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph) using its “Audi Al”. In November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position; however, there was still an employee in the car. In October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had travelled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 km) per month. In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialise a fully autonomous taxi service in the U.S.</p>
