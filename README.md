<h2 class="city">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
<p>An autonomous car, also known as a robotic car, self-driving car or driverless car. Is a vehicle that can sense its environment and moving with little or no human input. Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s; trials began in the 1950s.</p> 

<p>In 2017, Audi stated that its latest A8 would be automated at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph) using its “Audi Al”. In November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position; however, there was still an employee in the car. In October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had travelled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 km) per month. In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialise a fully autonomous taxi service in the U.S.</p>

<h2 class="city">Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Computer security software or cybersecurity or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. What does it do? Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks. In a computing context, security comprises cybersecurity and physical security – both are used by enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerised systems.</p>

<h2 class="city">Machine Learning</h2>
<p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. Colloquially, the term “artificial intelligence” is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic “cognitive” functions that humans associated with the human mind, such as “learning” and “problem solving”.</p>
