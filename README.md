<h2><i>Personal Information</i></h2>
  <p>Middle class born and raised in Makati City Metro Manila, Philippines. The year of 1990, I’ve arrived to live in Australia and the year of 1994 I become an Australian Citizen. I am very family oriented, a good listener, friendly, and a warm caring attitude. I am 47 years old with a wonderful partner, and a very proud mother of three beautiful independent children (years of ages from oldest 28, 26, 23) born and raised in Australia. Where I grew up, I am surrounded by 10 brothers and three sisters, so many of us but we all get along well.  My father is an educated professional Engineer for electrical, electronic, and mechanical, with his qualification earn him to be successful businessman to own a large company located right in Makati city Metro Manila. So, basically myself and my other sibling have seen a lot of kind of technical repairs that my father and his employees does, from a childhood to growing up our closest bonding with our parents are beyond. The gene of who we are, are shown what interest that we would like to learn and do, so most of my siblings, relatives, and including myself have a soft skill about electrical and electronic saga. My mother had a gift with a good heart, a warmth personality with smart brain in mathematics, she helps dad doing book work and take care of us at the same times even though she has a few maids. My mother does the bookkeeping manually into a simple book and I see hundreds of them kept stored in the filing metal cabinet. Seeing my parent’s achievement that drives me to be ambitious, and I’ll never stop to pursued to become an Engineer someday. </p>

<!-- Multiple similar elements -->
<h2 class="city">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
<p>An autonomous car, also known as a robotic car, self-driving car or driverless car. Is a vehicle that can sense its environment and moving with little or no human input. Experiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s; trials began in the 1950s.</p> 

<p>In 2017, Audi stated that its latest A8 would be automated at speeds of up to 60 kilometres per hour (37 mph) using its “Audi Al”. In November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position; however, there was still an employee in the car. In October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had travelled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 km) per month. In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialise a fully autonomous taxi service in the U.S.</p>
<p>What does it do? A self-driving car or driverless car. PC Mag defines a self-driving car as “A Computer-controlled car that drives itself. UCSUSA states that self-driving cars are “cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely opera the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or ‘driverless’ cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.</p>
<p>Homogenisation and decoupling – come from the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format.
Connectivity – means that users of a certain digital technology can connect easily with other users, other applications or even (other) enterprises.</p>
<p>Reprogrammable – another characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine.</p>
<p>Digital traces – Autonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and /or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles’ driving ability or safety.</p> 
<p>What is the state of the art of this new technology? Potential advantages;</p>
<p>Safety- driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, traffic collisions (and resulting deaths and injuries and costs), caused by human error, such as delayed reaction time, tailgating, rubbernecking, and other forms of distracted or aggressive driving should be substantially reduced.</p> 
<p>Welfare – Automated cars could reduce labor costs; relieve travellers from driving and navigation chores, thereby replacing behind-the-wheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work; and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive, distracted and texting while driving, intoxicated, prone to seizures, or otherwise impaired. For the young, the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income citizens, automated cars could provide enhanced mobility.</p>
<p>Traffic- additional advantages could include higher speed limits; smoother rides; and increased roadway capacity; and minimised traffic congestion, due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds.</p>
<p>Lower costs- Safer driving is expected to reduce the costs of vehicle insurance.</p>
<p>What can be done now? Social challenges; Government over-regulation, or even uncertainly about potential future regulation, may delay development of automated cars on the road.</p>
<p>Employment – Companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand. As such, education and training by third-party organisations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community-driven projects such as DIY Robocars and Formula Pi have bolstered graduate experience. Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources, such as code, datasets and glossaries to widen the recruitment pool.</p>
<p>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (3 years)?</p> 
Possible technological obstacles for automated cars are; 
Artificial Intelligence is still not able to function property in chaotic inner=city environments.
A car’s computer could potentially be compromised, as could a communication system between cars.
Susceptibility of the car’s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather (such as snow) or deliberate interference, including jamming and spoofing.
Avoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking, and Volvo found that software suited to caribou, deer, and elk was ineffective with Kangaroos.
Autonomous cars my require very high-quality specialised maps to operate properly. Where these maps may be out of date, they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviours. 
Competition for the radio spectrum desired for the car’s communication.
Field programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain.
Current road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally.

<h2 class="city">Cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Computer security software or cybersecurity or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. What does it do? Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems, including hardware, software and data, from cyberattacks. In a computing context, security comprises cybersecurity and physical security – both are used by enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerised systems.</p>

<h2 class="city">Machine Learning</h2>
<p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. Colloquially, the term “artificial intelligence” is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic “cognitive” functions that humans associated with the human mind, such as “learning” and “problem solving”.</p>
